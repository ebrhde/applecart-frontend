<h3>AppleCart frontend SPA</h3>

<p>This is my pet-project frontend part, based on Next.js framework.</p>

<p>The api & admin panel are in this repo git@github.com:ebrhde/applecart-yii.git. To run the project, clone both of the repos, set up the api part config via nginx, create .env.local file in the next.js application root and define NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ROOT env variable with api URI like NEXT_PUBLIC_API_ROOT=http[s]://[your_domain]/api/v1</p>
